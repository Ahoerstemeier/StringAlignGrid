History of the TStringAlignGrid

1995-12          only a global alignment of the text in the cells
1995-12-17  1.0  first published version, alignment for cells, columns or
                 global
1996-07-03  1.1  added reset methods to set the alignment back to the default
                 value
1996-12-14  1.2  rewrote the saving of data to the internal lists to make this
                 usable for saving other data
                 added individual hints for each cell
1997-02     1.3  internally only; added fonts the same way as the alignments
                 rewrote the Application.OnXXX handling for more flexibility
1997-03-07  1.4  added alignments and fonts for rows, created a component
                 editor to set the alignments, hints and cells at design time
                 and all the stuff needed to save this to the DFM files
1997-05-22  1.5  corrected bug with D2 and hints
                 corrected bug in component editor: the caption for left and
                 right alignment were mixed up
                 corrected strange behaviour of component editor: now cells
                 which will become fixed are shown as fixed, but allow edit
                 font colors now set back to clHighlightText when selected
                 added background colors the same way as the alignments
                 added font and color support in the component editor
                 added InPlaceEditor which also uses the special properties of
                 the respective cell
                 added utility functions like RemoveRow
                 RowMoving and ColMoving now supported correctly
