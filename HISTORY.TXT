History of the TStringAlignGrid

1995-12          only a global alignment of the text in the cells
1995-12-17  1.0  first published version, alignment for cells, columns or
                 global
1996-07-03  1.1  added reset methods to set the alignment back to the default
                 value
1996-12-14  1.2  rewrote the saving of data to the internal lists to make this
                 usable for saving other data
                 added individual hints for each cell
1997-02     1.3  internally only; added fonts the same way as the alignments
                 rewrote the Application.OnXXX handling for more flexibility
1997-03-07  1.4  added alignments and fonts for rows, created a component
                 editor to set the alignments, hints and cells at design time
                 and all the stuff needed to save this to the DFM files
1997-05-22  1.5  corrected bug with D2 and hints
                 corrected bug in component editor: the caption for left and
                 right alignment were mixed up
                 corrected strange behaviour of component editor: now cells
                 which will become fixed are shown as fixed, but allow edit
                 font colors now set back to clHighlightText when selected
                 added background colors the same way as the alignments
                 added font and color support in the component editor
                 added InPlaceEditor which also uses the special properties of
                 the respective cell
                 added utility functions like RemoveRow
                 RowMoving and ColMoving now supported correctly
1997-09-10  1.6  Enhanced Inplace-Edit: may be reset with ESC key, new events
                 BeforeEdit, AfterEdit, AfterCancel; single cells/rows/columns
                 can be set to read-only
                 Contents2CSV and CSV2Contents for ASCII import/export
                 Contents2HTML for HTML output
                 now uses brushs for the colors -> works in 256 colors also
                 allows to change colors for selection on cell/col/row basis
                 multi line texts (with #13#10 as line break) now supported
                 caused problems in Delphi 3 as AddExitProc won't work
                 properly with packages - now fixed
                 now doesn't let the IDE hints disappear anymore

Maybe in the next version
                 sorting of rows
                 import and export to ClipBoard
                 word wrap
                 vertically alignments
                 text rotated by 90 degrees
